# Capstone Project – Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains my work for the capstone project in the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London.

The focus of this project is to optimise a set of unknown functions using Bayesian optimisation and simpler baseline models such as linear regression. The functions are proxies for real-world optimisation problems, and the focus is on approaching them in a methodical and statistically responsible way — particularly given the limited data available.

Skills: Data Cleaning, Statistics, Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Visualization, Data Presentation.
