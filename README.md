# Capstone Project – Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains my work for the capstone project in the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London.

The focus of this project is to optimise a set of unknown functions using Bayesian optimisation and simpler baseline models such as linear regression. The functions are proxies for real-world optimisation problems, and the focus is on approaching them in a methodical and statistically responsible way — particularly given the limited data available.

This project is organised around each optimisation function.
Every function has its own folder so the code, documentation, and results stay together and easy to follow.

The structure is:
/functions
    /function_01
        README.md       # explanation of the function, method, and final results
        notebook.ipynb  # all experiments, plots, and model runs for this function
        /results        # final plots, tables, metrics (optional)
    /function_02
        README.md
        notebook.ipynb
        /results
