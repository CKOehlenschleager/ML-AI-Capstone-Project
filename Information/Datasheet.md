## Datasheet

Motivation: This data set was created in a Black-Box-optimization challenge. A certain amount of base observations was there for all functions, and an additional point was added each week for each function. This point was my query for the week.

Composition:The features of the eight data sets is all real numbers in [0,1]. The features describe a sample from a $[0,1]^k$ space, where $k$ is the number of features for the function. The data sets are complete with no missing values. The data sets have the following format:
Function 1: (25,3)
Function 2: (25,3)
Function 3:
Function 4:
Function 5:
Function 6:
Function 7:
Function 8:

Collection process: My quires were created by mainly using Bayesian optimization. The queires for the Function 1 and 2 is also based on some heuretis arguments. The project started xxx and subsequenctly each data set has increase with an observation each week.

Preprocessing and uses: I have not transformed the data set. As this is a data set generated from a Black-box-challegence it does not have attempt to necessarily replicate reality and hence should not be used to such a purpose.

Distribution and maintenance: The data set will be avaiable on this Github-page before the 31-01-2026. It is free to use and will not be updated and hence also not maintained.
